# Land Registration System using Blockchain and NFT Conversion

## Overview

Our project : The Land Registration System using Blockchain and NFT Conversion is a project aimed at revolutionizing the process of land registration by leveraging blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). 
This system provides a secure, transparent, and immutable platform for registering land ownership and transactions.

## Features

- **MetaMask Login:** We have used MetaMask for login/Signup along with user authentication and verification.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of land registration data.

- **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of land registration data.
- **NFT Conversion:** Converts land ownership records into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), providing unique digital representations of each land parcel.
- **Metamask Integration:** Enables users to sign transactions securely using Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet browser extension.
- **Add Land Using Longitude and Latitude:** Allows users to add land parcels by specifying longitude and latitude coordinates, ensuring precise identification of land boundaries.

## Workflow

1. **User Authentication:** Users authenticate themselves using Metamask to securely access the system.
2. **Add Land Parcel:**
   - User inputs longitude and latitude coordinates to define the boundaries of the land parcel.
   - The system generates a unique NFT representing the land parcel.
   - Land details, including owner information, are stored on the blockchain.
3. **Transfer Ownership:**
   - Users can transfer ownership of land parcels by initiating a transaction through Metamask.
   - Ownership transfer is recorded on the blockchain, updating the NFT ownership information accordingly.
4. **View Land Details:**
   - Users can view detailed information about registered land parcels, including ownership history and boundary coordinates.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum blockchain for decentralized data storage and transaction recording.
- **Smart Contracts:** Ethereum smart contracts for implementing business logic and rules.
- **NFT Standards:** ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards for creating Non-Fungible Tokens.
- **Metamask:** Integration with Metamask for secure transaction signing and user authentication.
- **Frontend:** User interface developed using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend:** Backend server handling interactions with the blockchain network and data processing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/land-registration-system.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd land-registration-system
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Metamask:

   - Install Metamask extension in your browser.
   - Connect Metamask to the Ethereum test network (e.g., Ropsten).
   - Import or create a new Ethereum account.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
